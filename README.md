# Life on Us!  

## Background

Human eyes can only see what they can see. The smallest visible object to them is just around 0.1mm (or ~ $\frac{1}{213}$in). Truth is they can't see the microbes ... Thanks to the modern hi-tech microscope with high resolution and manifying capability, now we can see the worlds that we couldn't see before - the worlds of different microbes that live on our body. To them, our body is their earth as the earth to human race.  

In recent research project from the Dept. of Applied Ecology of the North Carolina University, the scientists collected human belly button samples and develop a database that catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (aka "**Operational Taxonomic Units**", or "**OTUs**", in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This Data Anylitics and Visualization project utilizing 3 different chart types: horizontal bar, bubble, and gauge charts of the **Plotly.js** library to shed lights on several questions:  

<ol>
    <li>What are the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) found in each sample?</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ol>






What and how many species live in the belly button?
Why are some species common in many belly buttons and (most) others are rare?
What factors determine the number and kinds of microbes we see in individual belly buttons?
 
 will help answer the questions

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
